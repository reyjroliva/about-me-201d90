  </header>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>My name is Rey Oliva. I'm 25 years old and grew up in Tampa, FL. I moved to Seattle in August 2020 after graduating from the University of Florida with a degree in Computer Science Engineering. I began working for Facebook as an iOS engineer on the News Feed in September of 2020 and worked there for 2 years. This is my first week at CodeFellows as an instructor. My goal is to learn how to be a great instructor for 201 from Audrey and feedback from our students.</p>
